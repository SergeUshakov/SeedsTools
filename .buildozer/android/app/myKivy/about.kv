            text: 'This program is designed to control the planter when applying seeds of various crops. Control is carried out by pre-installed volumetric motion sensors. The sensors are universal and interchangeable; they do not require preliminary installation. You just need to turn on the sensor and pair it with your phone. This is done automatically. All information about the operation of the seeder is displayed on the phone screen. In the event of an emergency, a message is displayed on the phone screen immediately. This can be low or high seeding speed, no seeds in the hopper, interruption of seed supply due to clogged seed pipe.'
