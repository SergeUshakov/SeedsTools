'This program is designed to control the planter
                    when applying seeds of various crops. Control is carried out
                    by pre-installed volumetric motion sensors. The sensors are
                    universal and interchangeable; they do not require preliminary
                    installation. You just need to turn on the sensor and pair it
                    with your phone. This is done automatically. All information
                    about the operation of the seeder is displayed on the phone screen.
                    In the event of an emergency, a message is displayed on the
                    phone screen immediately. This can be low or high seeding speed,
                    no seeds in the hopper, interruption of seed supply due
                    to clogged seed pipe.'
